We‚Äôre thrilled to have you here and hope you find what you're looking for :raised_hands:.

## What We Do
[Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) is an **application-driven** AI platform within the [Helmholtz Association](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/), Germany's largest scientific organization. 
Designed to bridge the gap between traditional scientific research and AI, we aim to integrate AI into the Helmholtz Association's [core research areas](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/).
Our mission is to **democratize AI** by connecting AI researchers with domain experts and ensuring access to resources and expertise, making the latest advancements in AI accessible to everyone.
The annual [Helmholtz AI project call](https://www.helmholtz.ai/you-helmholtz-ai/project-funding/) is an attractive funding initiative aimed at supporting collaborative, interdisciplinary AI 
research projects within Helmholtz. 
Our dedicated HPC system [HAICORE](https://www.helmholtz.ai/you-helmholtz-ai/computing-resources/) (**H**elmholtz **AI** **Co**mputing **Re**sources) offers powerful computational resources specifically designed 
for AI applications, allowing Helmholtz researchers to perform large-scale data processing, training of ML models, and other compute-heavy AI tasks.

With [Helmholtz AI consulting](https://www.helmholtz.ai/you-helmholtz-ai/ai-consulting/), we empower all Helmholtz researchers to leverage cutting-edge AI methods for solving their scientific problems. 
Our consultants provide support and expertise in applied AI, tools, and software engineering, ensuring that researchers in fields like biology, physics, or climate science can use AI technologies without 
needing to be AI specialists themselves.
Working with our consultants comes at no cost, as collaborations are entirely scientific.

## Local Unit Energy at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
Helmholtz energy researchers are working to find innovative solutions to meet the energy demands of current and future generations. 
As the [Helmholtz AI consultant team @ KIT](https://www.helmholtz.ai/applied-ai/ai-consultancy-teams/goetz-team/) led by [Markus G√∂tz](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/staff/11452.php), we support the **Energy** research 
field by offering expertise in cutting-edge AI methods.
AI applications in energy research are as diverse as the field itself, ranging from energy system load forecasting and discovering new materials for energy storage technologies like batteries, 
to automating industrial system control.

To address these challenges, we leverage advanced AI approaches with a special focus on:

- üñºÔ∏è Image analysis
- üìà Time series
- Graph-based problems
- Uncertainty quantification
- Model search
- Large-scale parallel processing

These capabilities allow us to tackle a variety of AI tasks, including regression, classification, segmentation, and interpolation. 
We are also committed to open and reproducible research, ensuring our code and data are accessible through open-source platforms.
